                    </div>
                    <p>Huzaifa Usman was just 21 years old when he co-founded the Huzaifa Foundation with a
                        clear vision: to build a world where every individual, especially the most vulnerable,
                        can thrive. Huzaifa’s experiences growing up in a community filled with untapped potential
                        fueled his passion for social change.</p>
                    <p> While pursuing his degree in civil engineering at the University of Brighton, Huzaifa recognized that building a
                        sustainable society is not just about infrastructure—it's about people. It’s about
                        ensuring that every child can dream, every woman can succeed, and every youth can lead.
                        His journey led to the birth of the Huzaifa Foundation, an organization dedicated to
                        helping those who need it most through education, economic empowerment, and advocacy.</p>

                <p class="p-text">
                    Founded in 2020 by a visionary leader from Kaduna State, Nigeria, the Huzaifa Foundation (HF) is a
                    dynamic non-governmental organization (NGO) committed to creating a brighter, fairer, and more sustainable
                    future. This foundation was established with a singular mission: to put smiles on the faces of individuals who are marginalized and underserved.
                </p>
                <p class="p-text">
                    Our foundation serves as a beacon of hope, especially for children, youth, and women,
                    who are often overlooked. Through a range of educational, economic, and empowerment programs,
                    we work to break the cycle of poverty and inequality, enabling individuals to reach their full
                    potential and contribute meaningfully to society.
                </p>
                <p class="p-text">The world is full of potential, but far too many individuals are held back by circumstances beyond their
                    control. Whether it's poverty, lack of education, or societal inequality, the barriers are significant but
                    not insurmountable. We exist to break down these barriers, offering a lifeline to those who need it most.
                </p>
                <p class="p-text">This foundation was created because we believe that change is possible, and we are committed to driving that change.
                    By investing in education, providing opportunities for empowerment, and advocating for equality, we are working
                    to create a more just and equitable society.
